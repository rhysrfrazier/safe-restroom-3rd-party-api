# Safe Restrooms 3rd-Party API
Public restrooms are the most wide-spread explicitly gendered spaces in the United States. Though recent years have seen an increase in single-stall unisex and family restrooms, the majority of public restrooms remain designated for "male" or "female" use. As a result, folx whose bodies and/or gender expressions fall outside of the perceived binary "norm" often find that they "stand out" more in public restrooms than in other less- or non-gendered spaces, often leading to increased rates of harrassment. In light of recent anti-trans legislation in the United States, many trans and GNC folx feel increasingly unsafe simply exercising a bodily function while doing errands, traveling, or spending time with family and friends in public settings.

The "old-school" way of finding safer establishments or unisex restrooms relied largely on word-of-mouth and trial and error; however, this method is not always be feasible. In order to spread information further in the community, [Refuge Restrooms](https://www.refugerestrooms.org/about) has assembled an open-access database of public restrooms safe for use by trans and GNC folx. Many of the items in this database are the result of user submissions.
## Aim and Scope of this Project
This project aims to create a 3rd-party API interface that returns addresses of public restrooms safe for use by trans/GNC folx. Results will include whether the restroom is accessible by persons with disabilities, whether unisex restrooms are available, and whether baby changing stations are available.

## Anticipated Challenges
- I would like to show a minimum of 10 results per user query (where ten results are available). Making sure this section of code is concise will likely be challenging for me (but loops will be my friends).
- In order to keep the response cards clean and easy to read at a glance, I'd like to use checks and exes to indicate whether each result offers accessibility, unisex stalls, and changing stations. Formatting these in CSS and ensuring they can be read by screen-readers will be another challenge.
- The most direct way to search by city is via a call that searches for the terms throughout the ENTIRE contents of the API. This takes upwards of 10 seconds. It is much quicker to search via latitude and longitude, but most folx don't know their lat and long offhand. I have two options for stretch goals to address this: the first is to figure out how to generate a loading wheel so folks know not to spam the submit button; the second is to link an additional geolocation API and use the return from that inside the API call to refuge restrooms, so the results generate quicker (hopefully eliminating the need for the loading wheel).
- Additional stretch goal: redirecting to the google maps page for a given address when you click the card.
